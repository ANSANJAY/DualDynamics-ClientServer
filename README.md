# DualDynamics-ClientServer
An elegant and modular implementation of both client and server-side protocols for efficient data communication. Crafted with modern best practices, this repository offers comprehensive examples and documentation for enthusiasts and professionals alike to understand and deploy client-server interactions.


# Client-Server State Machine Implementation

This repository offers a detailed understanding of the client-server state machine using the socket API. Learn how functions like `socket()`, `bind()`, `listen()`, `accept()`, `connect()`, `send()`, and `recv()` interplay to establish and manage connections.

## Server State Machine

### 1. Create Socket (`socket()` call)

The server initiates the communication process by creating a socket, which serves as the endpoint for sending or receiving data.

### 2. Bind Socket (`bind()` call)

The `bind()` function associates the socket with a specific IP address and port number, preparing it to listen for incoming connections on that address.

### 3. Listen (`listen()` call)

After binding, the server listens for incoming client connections using the `listen()` function. This sets the server socket in a listening state, specifying the length of the queue for incoming connection requests.

### 4. Accept Connection (`accept()` call)

The server waits for client connections using the `accept()` function. This function is typically blocking, meaning it waits until a client connects. Upon a connection, it returns a new socket specifically for that client.

### 5. Receive & Send Data (`recv()` & `send()` calls)

With the connection established, the server can exchange data with the client using the `recv()` and `send()` functions.

## Client State Machine

### 1. Create Socket (`socket()` call)

The client also starts by creating a socket, enabling it to initiate communication with the server.

### 2. Connect to Server (`connect()` call)

The client connects to a listening server using the `connect()` function. It requires the IP address and port number of the server to establish this connection.

### 3. Send & Receive Data (`send()` & `recv()` calls)

Once the connection is made, the client and server can exchange data using the `send()` and `recv()` functions.

## Key Concepts

### Why is `accept()` blocking?

The `accept()` function is designed to block so that the server can efficiently wait for incoming connections without constant polling. For non-blocking behavior, consider setting the socket to non-blocking mode or using `select()` or `epoll()` mechanisms.

### Role of `connect()`

The `connect()` function enables the client to initiate a connection to a listening server by providing the server's IP and port. If the server isn't active or there are network issues, this call will fail.
